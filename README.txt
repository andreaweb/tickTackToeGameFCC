TICK TACK TOE GAME - FREE CODE CAMP

Project built as part of Free Code Camp's curriculum. Used HTML, CSS and JS (Jquery).

This is the classical game with 3 rows and 3 lines; the goal is to complete a row, a line or a diagonal line with your symbol (O or X).
The AI isn't very smart here, though.

A HEADS-UP ABOUT MY GITHUB ACCOUNT

Since at my job I use a different github account, I currently find more practical to start and update personal projects at my CodePen ( http://codepen.io/andreaweb/ ). I will deff commit more and more in this github account, but for the moment it'll happen mostly at weekends and the occasional holiday. It'll happen EVERY weekend though!

I also wanna be more active in the community and collaborate in other projects. If you think I can be useful, please e-mail me at return.santana@gmail.com

Thanks!
